ISBN dependency parser (idp) - Incremental Sigmoid Belief Network Dependency Parser
============================

Installation Instructions
=========================

The parser was developed for Linux and was not tested on any other platform.

DEPENDENCIES

The parser requires:

-  GNU Scientific Library (GSL)

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
Download  and install.  If on execution of the parser 
(idp) you still get:  "cannot open shared object file *gsl*so.", 
make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is defined and points to the location of GSL 
dynamic library. E.g., if you are using bash you might need to add to ~/.bashrc
the following lines:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you installed GSL library not in a default path you will need to edit your 
~/.bashrc accordingly and also edit 
Makefile of ISBN dependency parser. Add to CFLAGS -I<GSL_PATH>/include and to LDFLAGS
-L<GSL_PATH>/lib.


- Implementation of (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) pseudo-projective  transformations, 
which allows to  cast  non-projective projective parsing tasks as projective. 
If you consider projective treebanks or use a different projectivization method 
you should be able to change the scripts accordingly.
A version of this software is supplied within idp and it is used by
preprocessing scripts.

- Java (JRE at least 1.5.x is recommended)

Both pseudo-projective transformations software and a preprocessing module for
idp are java applications.


- Perl, version at least 5.8.1

This is required to run evaluation scripts and for conversion between UTF-8 and
ASCII.

- Python

For format validation (validateFormat.py)

INSTALLATION

Unpack the code in any directory.
It has the following structure:

parser/src    Main parser code
scripts/   Pre- and postprocessing scripts (see README), eval07.pl 
    (CoNLL-2007 official eval07.pl script)
scripts/pseudoproj  Pseudo-Projective  transformations software
scripts/preprocessor Conversion of CoNLL format to the format accepted by the parser
sampe/   Sample configuration files

Change directory to parser/src/ and type

make

idp is the main executable and it is created in the parser/ directory.
As described in README you might need to change some constants defined
in definition file isbn.h depending on properties of your treebank and rebuild the parser:

make clean all

See README for instructions.
