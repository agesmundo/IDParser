here is how to compute the figures you required:

//these files are in scripts/conll2008
-- store the file CoNLL.pm in a directory
-- store the files evalb_cr.pl and treerf.pl in the same directory
-- change the line

  use lib "/home/gam/tmp/sharedtask";

  into
    use lib "<the dir where you stored CoNLL.pm>";

-- to get the crossing arcs performance, run

./evalb_cr.pl <GOLD in CoNLL 2008 format> <OUT in CoNLL 2008 format> > <EVALB resulting file>

<EVALB resulting file> details for each sentence the results. You can ignore it. The figures you need will be printed on stderr and look like this:

794 1279 2697
P  62.08 R  29.44 F  39.94
2824 CoNLL records done

This is the result we got last year on the test set. For this year, i guess you will be using the devel set.

-- to get the number of semantic graphs that are trees, run on the training data set

./treerf.pl <GOLD TRAIN in CoNLL 2008 format>

and you should get some output like this one:

39279 CoNLL records done
8402 CoNLL trees
21.39%

-- it turns out that james computed the % of sentences that contains syntactic crossing arcs and the % of sentences containing semantic crossing arcs. as far as i remember these figures were simply computed on the derivations and a sentence contains a crossing arc iff a swap operation was triggered.

if that doesnt work, i'll look into it this weekend. Since i have been able to reproduce all the results we cited last year, that should work as is ... assuming the data are in our beloved conll 2008 format.
